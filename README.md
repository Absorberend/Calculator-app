# Calculator app
This is my solution for the "Calculator app" challenge of Frontend Mentor.

What I like about Frontend Mentor is that they give you some details about what they like to see and sometimes some images but that's about it.
You're not given a solution so it's all on you to try and recreate the project as accurately as possible.

In this project I had to figure out all the calculator logic and also how to store the themes in the localStorage.
